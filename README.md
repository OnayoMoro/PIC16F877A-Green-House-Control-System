# PIC16F877A-Green-House-Control-System
This combines the use of a PIC16F877A development board and a lcd12864 panel the create a green house control system

Programmed in C and assembly for a PIC (Programmable Interface Controller) microcontroller. Some constraints that made this project a challenge was the limited 8-byte stack and the limited program and data memory.
